Weekly problem sets to reinforce the concepts from the reading as
well as the material that we address in class. You're encouraged to work on the 
problem sets with fellow students, though you'll both need to turn in your own 
work. Problem sets are due every **Monday** at the beginning of class.

**PS1**: Please work through problems 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 22 in the Exercises at the end of Chapter 1 (the first one is labeled 1.1 on page 43).
