Welcome to the Age of Data, where information is all around us, helping us live 
happier, healthier lives. Or does it? Do we know yet if cell phones cause 
cancer? Have we come to a decision on whether we should be eating lots of meat 
or none at all to stay healthy? Despite all of this information, it can be 
challenging to turn it into the knowledge from which we can make sound
decisions.

Statistics is the field that aims to bridge this gap between information and 
knowledge and this course is an application-oriented introduction to modern 
statistical modeling and inference. We will discuss topics such as: study design, 
descriptive statistics, data visualization, random variables, probability and 
sampling distributions, point and interval estimates, hypothesis tests, 
resampling procedures, and multiple regression. A wide variety of applications 
from the natural and social sciences will be used.

### Textbook

[OpenIntro: Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) (2014),
by Diez, Barr and Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, available in three formats: pdf, 
tablet-friendly pdf, and paperback edition. The textbook is free and open-source,
but you're encouraged to purchase the paperback edition through amazon for < $10.

The textbook is a key component of the course. Our class will maintain a reading
group at [nb.mit.edu](http://nb.mit.edu), which provides us with a 
communal annotation engine. You will be asked to make and respond to reading 
notes online, as class time will focus on activities to help understand concepts.

#### Labs

We meet in the laboratory (ETC 211) every Tuesday to tinker around with data and
statistics. Our tools of choice are R and RStudio, software that vastly amplifies 
your power to explore, visualize, and model data. Reed's RStudio server is 
accessible by going to [https://rstudio.reed.edu/](https://rstudio.reed.edu/) 
and using your college login.

Every week you'll be working with a new data set and organizing your work in an
RMarkdown document. These will be submitted through moodle and will be due the
following Monday morning at 10 am.

#### Problem Sets

There will be weekly problem sets to reinforce the concepts from the readings as
well as the material that we address in class. You're encouraged to work on the 
problem sets with fellow students, though you'll both need to turn in your own 
work.

#### Exams

We'll have several examinations throughout the semester in order to challenge
your understanding and provide me with a sense of where you're at. Some will
be more traditional pen and paper and others are to be done with the computer
using R.

#### Projects

The best way to improve your skill in statistics is to do statistics on a real
problem. There will be two small projects this semester that where you'll have
the opportunity to go through a full statistical analysis from soup to nuts.

#### More Resources

Dedicated tutors will be available at the DoJo, times TBA.
