Welcome to the Age of Data, where information is all around us, helping us live 
happier, healthier lives. Or does it? Do we know yet if cell phones cause 
cancer? Have we come to a decision on whether we should be eating lots of meat 
or none at all to stay healthy? Despite all of this information, it can be 
challenging to turn it into the knowledge from which we can make sound
decisions.

Statistics is the field that aims to bridge this gap between information and 
knowledge and this course is an application-oriented introduction to modern 
statistical modeling and inference. We will discuss topics such as: study design, 
descriptive statistics, data visualization, random variables, probability and 
sampling distributions, point and interval estimates, hypothesis tests, 
resampling procedures, multiple regression, and Bayesian models. A wide variety 
of applications from the natural and social sciences will be used.
