## Exploratory analysis

Load the `nc` data set into our workspace.

```{r load-data, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(oilabs)
head(nc)
```


1.  What are the cases in this data set? How many cases are there in our sample?

*Each case corresponds to one birth in NC in 2004. There are 1000 such cases.*

2.  As you review the variable summaries, consider which variables are categorical 
and which are numerical. For numerical variables, are there outliers? If you 
aren't sure or want to take a closer look at the data, make a plot.

```{r hists, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
qplot(data = nc, x = fage, color = I("white"))
qplot(data = nc, x = mage, color = I("white"))
qplot(data = nc, x = weeks, color = I("white"))
qplot(data = nc, x = visits, color = I("white"))
qplot(data = nc, x = gained, color = I("white"))
qplot(data = nc, x = weight, color = I("white"))
```

*There appears to be outliers with each numerical variable.*

2.  Make a side-by-side boxplot of `habit` and `weight`. What does the plot 
highlight about the relationship between these two variables?

```{r ex2, warning=FALSE}
qplot(x = habit, y = weight, data = nc, geom = "boxplot")
```

*The plot reveals that there are some missing values for this variable. Between
smokers and non-smokers, the former has a slightly lower Q1, Q2, and Q3 birth weight
compared to the latter. Both show evidence of a left skew, though the larger
number of low outliers in the nonsmoker group is probably due simply to the fact
that there were more of them.*

## Inference

3.  Write the hypotheses for testing if the average weights of babies born to 
smoking and non-smoking mothers are different.

$$H_0: \mu_{smoking} = \mu_{nonsmoking}; \quad \textrm{or} \quad \mu_{smoking} - \mu_{nonsmoking} = 0 $$
$$H_A: \mu_{smoking} - \mu_{nonsmoking} \neq 0$$

*where $\mu$ is the mean birthweight within each group*.

4.  What is our test statistic? What distribution would you expect it to follow

*The test statistic is*


$$ T = \dfrac{\bar{X}_{smoking} - \bar{X}_{nonsmoking}}{SE \text{ of } \bar{X}_{smoking} - \bar{X}_{nonsmoking}} $$

*where* 

$$SE \text{ of } \bar{X}_{smoking} - \bar{X}_{nonsmoking} = \sqrt{\dfrac{s_{smoking}^2}{n_{smoking}} + \dfrac{s_{nonsmoking}^2}{n_{nonsmoking}}}.$$

*We expect it to follow a $t$ distribution with 125 degrees of freedom or the
Normal distribution.*

4.  Check if the conditions necessary for inference are satisfied. Note that 
you will need to obtain sample sizes to check the conditions. You can compute 
the group size using the same chain above but replacing summarizing each group
with `n()` instead of `mean(weight)`.

*There are several assumptions we're making if we model the above test statistic
using the t-distribution. The first is that each observation is independent of 
one another. As this is a random sample of all (very large number of) births in
NC in 2004, that assumption is reasonable.*

*The second assumption is the population within each group is nearly normally
distributed. As we saw in the boxplots above, there is some evidence of left
skew. However, we see that the number of observations in each group is quite
high:*

```{r ex4, eval=TRUE}
nc %>%
  group_by(habit) %>%
  summarize(n())
```

*Because of this, the nearly normal condition can be relaxed as the central
limit theorem is beginning to kick in. Furthermore, at this large a number of
observations, even though we don't know $\sigma$, our estimate using $s$ will
be pretty good, so this sampling distribution will also be well-approximated
by the Normal distribution.*


5.  Change the `type` argument to `"ci"` to construct and record a confidence 
interval for the difference between the weights of babies born to smoking and 
non-smoking mothers.

```{r ex5, eval = TRUE}
inference(y = nc$weight, x = nc$habit, est = "mean", type = "ci", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical")
```

*The 95% confidence interval for the true difference between mean birth weights of
babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers is (.0534, .5777).*

By default the function reports an interval for ($\mu_{nonsmoker} - \mu_{smoker}$)
. We can easily change this order by using the `order` argument:

```{r inf-weight-habit-ci, tidy=FALSE}
inference(y = nc$weight, x = nc$habit, est = "mean", type = "ci", null = 0, 
          alternative = "twosided", method = "theoretical", 
          order = c("smoker","nonsmoker"))
```

* * *

## On your own

For the following inferential exercises, be sure to assess the conditions for
inference.

-   Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average length of pregnancies 
(`weeks`) and interpret it in context. Note that since you're doing inference 
on a single population parameter, there is no explanatory variable, so you can 
omit the `x` variable from the function.

*As this is a random sample, our observations are independent. There is some 
left skew in the distribution of `weeks`, but the sample size is sufficient
that the nearly normal condition can be relaxed.*

```{r oyo1, eval = TRUE}
inference(y = nc$weeks, est = "mean", type = "ci", method = "theoretical")
```


-   Calculate a new confidence interval for the same parameter at the 90% 
confidence level. You can change the confidence level by adding a new argument 
to the function: `conflevel = 0.90`.

*Conditions are the same as above.*

```{r oyo2, eval = TRUE}
inference(y = nc$weeks, est = "mean", type = "ci", method = "theoretical",
          conflevel = .90)
```

-   Conduct a hypothesis test evaluating whether the average weight gained by 
younger mothers is different from the average weight gained by mature mothers.
Be sure to state hypotheses.

$$ H_0: \mu_{mature} - \mu_{younger} = 0 $$
$$ H_A: \mu_{mature} - \mu_{younger} \neq 0 $$

*Where each $\mu$ represents the mean weight gained by the mothers in each group. 
As this is a random sample, our observations are independent. There is some 
right skew in the distribution of weight gains, but the sample size is sufficient
that the nearly normal condition can be relaxed.*

```{r oyo3, eval = TRUE}
inference(y = nc$gained, x = nc$mature, 
  est = "mean", type = "ht", 
  alternative = "twosided", null = 0,
  method = "theoretical")
```

*With a p-value of .1686, the observed difference in weights was not significant
at the $\alpha = .05$ level, therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis
that the two groups of mothers have the same mean weight gain.*


-   Now, a non-inference task: Determine the age cutoff for younger and mature 
mothers. Use a method of your choice, and explain how your method works.

*I create a chain to group the `nc` data set by each category within the `mature`
variable, then I find the min and max within each. We see that the youngest
mature mothers are 35 and the oldest younger mothers are 34, which reveals the 
cutoff at 34/35.*

```{r oyo4, eval = TRUE}
nc %>%
  group_by(mature) %>%
  summarize(min(mage), max(mage))
```


-   Pick a pair of numerical and categorical variables and come up with a 
research question evaluating the relationship between these variables. 
Formulate the question in a way that it can be answered using a hypothesis test
and/or a confidence interval. Please outline the hypotheses, utilize the `inference()` 
function, report the statistical results, and also provide an explanation in 
plain language.

*Is the pregnancy of male versus female children associated with a different
average number of hospital visits, on average? This can be assessed by evaluating
the following hypotheses.*

$$ H_0: \mu_{male} - \mu_{female} = 0 $$
$$ H_A: \mu_{male} - \mu_{female} \neq 0 $$

*Where each $\mu$ is the mean number of hospital visits during pregnancy within
each group. In order for our test statistic to be well-approximated by the t
(or normal) distribution, certain conditions should be met. Because the
data arise from a random sample, the observations can be considered to be
independent. The boxplots below show the data to be fairly symmetric about the
center, therefore the nearly normal condition is met.*

```{r, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
qplot(x = sex, y = visits, data = nc, geom = "boxplot")
```

*Although there is very little difference evident in the plot, we continue on
with the hypothesis test just to be sure.*

```{r oyo5b, eval = TRUE}
inference(y = nc$visits, x = nc$sex, est = "mean", type = "ht", alternative = "twosided", 
          method = "theoretical", null = 0)
```

*The p-value is 0.205, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the .05 level. 
We find no strong evidence that the number of hospital visits made by a mother 
during pregnancy is associated with the sex of the baby.*
