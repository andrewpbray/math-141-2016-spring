1.  Is this an observational study or an experiment? The original research
    question posed in the paper is whether beauty leads directly to the
    differences in course evaluations. Given the study design, is it possible to
    answer this question as it is phrased? If not, rephrase the question.
    
*This is an observational study making it difficult to make causal claims. The
more appropriate research question would be whether there is an association 
between beauty and course evaluation score.*

2.  Describe the distribution of `score`. Is the distribution skewed? What does 
    that tell you about how students rate courses? Is this what you expected to 
    see? Why, or why not?
    
```{r}
qplot(x = score, data = evals, binwidth = 0.1, color = I("white"))
summary(evals$score)
```

*The distribution of score takes a range between about 2.5 and 5, has a median
score of 4.3 and an IQR of just less than 1. The shape is skewed to the left, 
which is what I expected. Students tend to be fairly generous, rating their 
professors either 4's or 5's, though occasionally there will be a professor that
is quite unpopular. Even so, I am surprised at how high the minimum actually
was: 2.3.*


3.  Excluding `score`, select two other variables and describe their relationship 
    using an appropriate visualization (scatterplot, side-by-side boxplots, or 
    bar plots).
    
```{r}
qplot(x = language, y = bty_avg, data = evals, geom = "boxplot")
```

*Answers may vary. I chose to look first at the relationship between the native
language of the professor and beauty average. The side-by-side boxplots 
show a lower median score for the English speakers. There are no outliers in the
english group and one in the non-english.  There is more spread for english than for
non-english.

```{r}
qplot(x = rank, fill = gender, data = evals, geom = "bar")
```

*The second relationship that I investigated was between `gender` and `rank`. The
stacked bar plot shows much higher representation of men at the tenured rank 
(around 70% of tenured faculty are men). The teaching faculty was an even split 
and the tenure track faculty show an over-representation of women (around two 
thirds).*

```{r scatter-score-bty_avg}
qplot(x = bty_avg, y = score, data = evals, geom = "point")
```

4.  Re-plot the scatterplot, but this time, jitter each of the points a bit by
    adding an additional layer to the plotting function: `+ geom_jitter()`.
    What was misleading about the initial scatterplot?
    
```{r}
qplot(x = bty_avg, y = score, data = evals, geom = "point") + geom_jitter()
```

*The initial scatterplot has lots of over-plotting - one dot representing many
observations. Jittering fixes this by moving each of those stacks of dots just
a bit so that they're no longer on top of one another.*

5.  Let's see if the apparent trend in the plot is something more than
    natural variation. Fit a linear model called `m_bty` to predict average
    professor score by average beauty rating. Write out the equation for the 
    linear model and interpret the slope. Is average beauty score a statistically
    significant predictor? Does it appear to be a practically significant predictor?

```{r}
m_bty <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)
summary(m_bty)
```

$$ \hat{y} = 3.88 + 0.06 \times bty\_avg $$

It is a statistically significant predictor based on the small $p$-value.  One would hope
that beauty was not, in practice, a predictor of score though.

6.  Use residual plots to evaluate whether the conditions of least squares
    regression are reasonable. Provide plots and comments for each one (see
    the Simple Regression Lab for a reminder of how to make these).

```{r}
qplot(x = .fitted, y = .stdresid, data = m_bty) + geom_jitter()
qplot(sample = .stdresid, data = m_bty) + geom_abline()
```

*The linearity assumption seems reasonable given that our residual plot
is fairly structure-less and the residuals are centered at zero across the range
of fitted values. The constant variance assumption is also reasonable as the variance
in the residuals looks to be constant across the range of fitted values. The
more problematic assumption is that of normally distributed errors. The qq plot
shows that we have a left skewed distribution (long left tail, short right tail).
Finally, regarding the assumption of independent errors, there is no sign in the 
residuals of serial correlation. In terms of how the data was collected, if each
row in our data set corresponds to a unique professor, it's unlikely that 
there are over 4000 professors at this university, so we have reason to think
that our sample constitutes more than 10% of the population and therefore
that our errors may not be independent of one another.*


```{r scatter-score-bty_avg_gender}
m_bty_gen <- lm(score ~ bty_avg + gender, data = evals)
summary(m_bty_gen)
```

7.  $P$-values and parameter estimates should only be trusted if the
    conditions for the regression are reasonable. Verify that the conditions
    for this model are reasonable using diagnostic plots.
    
```{r}
qplot(x = .fitted, y = .stdresid, data = m_bty_gen) + geom_jitter()
qplot(sample = .stdresid, data = m_bty_gen) + geom_abline()
```

*The residual plot and the qq plot look very similar to that for the first model
and thus the conclusions are the same: the normality assumption in the errors
seems unrealistic and the independent errors assumption is questionable. Because
of this, we expect that our $p$-values and parameter estimates may be off.*


8.  Is `bty_avg` still a significant predictor of `score`? Has the addition
    of `gender` to the model changed the parameter estimate for `bty_avg`?

*Yes, `bty_avg` is still significant. The addition of `gender` has changed the
estimate only slightly, from 0.066 to 0.074.*


9.  What is the equation of the line corresponding to males? (*Hint:* For
    males, the parameter estimate is multiplied by 1.) For two professors
    who received the same beauty rating, which gender tends to have the
    higher course evaluation score?
    
$$ \hat{y} = (3.75 + 0.1724) + 0.074 \times bty\_avg $$
$$ \hat{y} = 3.92 + 0.074 \times bty\_avg $$

*For two professors of the same beauty rating, our model predicts that the male
professor will have a score that is 0.1723 points higher.*


10. Create a new model called `m_bty_rank` with `gender` removed and `rank` 
    added in. How does R appear to handle categorical variables that have more 
    than two levels? Note that the rank variable has three levels: `teaching`, 
    `tenure track`, `tenured`.
    
```{r}
m_bty_rank <- lm(score ~ bty_avg + rank, data = evals)
summary(m_bty_rank)
```

*R has taken the `rank` variable and strung it out into 2 dummy variables to
account for the three possible levels: tenure-track, tenured, and teaching.*

We will start with a full model that predicts professor score based on rank, 
ethnicity, gender, language of the university where they got their degree, age, 
proportion of students that filled out evaluations, class size, course level, 
number of professors, number of credits, average beauty rating, outfit, and 
picture color.

11. Which variable would you expect to have the highest $p$-value in this model? 
    Why? *Hint:* Think about which variable would you expect to not have any 
    association with the professor score.
    
*I'd expect `pic_color` to have the highest $p$-value in the model since it seems
like it should be independent of score.*

Let's run the model...

```{r m_full, tidy = FALSE}
m_full <- lm(score ~ rank + ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval 
             + cls_students + cls_level + cls_profs + cls_credits + bty_avg 
             + pic_outfit + pic_color, data = evals)
```

12. Check your suspicions from the previous exercise. Include the model output
    in your response.
    
    
```{r}
summary(m_full)
```

*I was wrong: `pic_color` was actually significant, with a $p$-value of 0.02. The
highest $p$-value was for `cls_prof`.*

13. Interpret the coefficient associated with the ethnicity variable.

*Holding all other variables in the model constant, we expect a professor that is
considered "not minority" to have a score that is 0.123 points higher than
a professor that is considered "minority".*

14. Drop the variable with the highest $p$-value and re-fit the model. Did the
    coefficients and significance of the other explanatory variables change?
    (One of the things that makes multiple regression interesting is that
    coefficient estimates depend on the other variables that are included in
    the model.) If not, what does this say about whether or not the dropped
    variable was collinear with the other explanatory variables?
    
```{r}
m_full2 <- lm(score ~ rank + ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval + 
                cls_students + cls_level + cls_credits + bty_avg + pic_outfit + 
                pic_color, data = evals)
summary(m_full2)
```

*The coefficients and $p$-values have changed slightly, though the signs remain
the same as in the full model. This suggests that the dropped variable had
only minimal collinearity with the other explanatory variables.*


15. Using backward-selection and $p$-value as the selection criterion,
    determine the best model. (You may want to read over Subsection 6.2.2 of the text [here](https://drive.google.com/a/reed.edu/file/d/0B-DHaDEbiOGkRHNndUlBaHVmaGM/view)
    first if you haven't already.)  You do not need to show all steps in your
    answer, just the output for the final model. Also, write out the linear
    model for predicting score based on the final model you settle on.
    
```{r}
m_final <- lm(score ~ ethnicity + gender + language + age + cls_perc_eval + 
                cls_credits + bty_avg + pic_color, data = evals)
summary(m_final)
```

$$\hat{y} = 3.77 + 0.17 ethnicity\_not\_minority + 0.21 gendermale - 0.206 language\_non\_english \\
 -0.006 age + 0.004 cls\_perc\_eval + 0.505 cls\_credits\_one\_credit + 0.05 bty\_avg \\
 - 0.19 pic\_color\_color$$ 

16. Verify that the conditions for this model are reasonable using diagnostic 
    plots.

```{r}
qplot(x = .fitted, y = .stdresid, data = m_final) + geom_jitter()
qplot(sample = .stdresid, data = m_final) + geom_abline(col = "green")
```

*This model is violating assumptions left and right. The linear trend looks like
the only sensible assumption give that the residuals are centered at zero across
the range of the fitted values. The funnel-shaped pattern, however, indicates 
some decreasing variance. Additionally, our residuals are still left-skewed and
we have the same reservations about independence.*

17. Based on your final model, describe the characteristics of a professor and 
    course at University of Texas at Austin that would be associated with a high
    evaluation score.
    
*A high evaluation score would be associated with a professor who is male, not
a minority, a native English speaker, young, rated to have high beauty using
a black-and-white photo, has a high eval completion rate, and is teaching a
one credit course.*

18. The original paper describes how these data were gathered by taking a
    sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin and including 
    all courses that they have taught. Considering that each row represents a 
    course, could this new information have an impact on any of the conditions 
    of linear regression?
    
*This makes the assumption of independent errors even less tenable as we'd expect
that courses taught by the same professor will have similar scores.*

19. Would you be comfortable generalizing your conclusions to apply to professors
    generally (at any university)? Why or why not?
    
*We would be comfortable generalizing our conclusions to the broader population
of all professors if our sample is representative of that population (that's be once
we have a valid model). There is
good reason to think that the dynamics at play in a large research university like
UT Austin will be quite different than those at a small liberals arts college like,
say, Reed. Therefore we'd want to restrict our generalization to similar large 
universities.*
