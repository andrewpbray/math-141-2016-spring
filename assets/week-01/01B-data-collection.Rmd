## Landon v. FDR, 1936

Literary Digest polled 10 million Americans, 2.4 million responded.

N = 128 million, n = 2.4 million

**Prediction**: 43% for FDR

**Result**: 62% for FDR

## What went wrong? {.build}

Literary Digest surveyed

- magazine subscribers
- registered car owners
- registered telephone owners

These groups have a much higher income on average than the typical
american. In 1936 the Great Depression is still in full swing, so the 
typical (poorer) american was more supportive of FDR.

Their sampling method was **biased** (not representative).
