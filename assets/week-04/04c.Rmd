## Example from last time {.build}

How many quizzes should we have printed in total for MATH 141 today?

- The Registrar at Reed has told us that students tend to come to class about 93% of the time
- There are 38 students registered in total
- What specific assumptions are required for us to assume a Binomial/Independent Trials model?
    - Students come to class _independently_ of one another
    - Each student has a 93% chance of attending class today
    - Students either come to class or they don't
- What does this distribution look like?

## 

Probability distribution for $X \sim Pois(\lambda = 3.68)$.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
x <- rpois(1e6, 3.68)
qplot(x, geom = "bar")
```
