At a university, 13% of students smoke.

  - Calculate the expected number of smokers in a random sample of 100 students from this
university.
  - The university gym opens at 9 am on Saturday mornings. One Saturday morning at 8:55
am there are 27 students outside the gym waiting for it to open. Should you use the
same approach from part (a) to calculate the expected number of smokers among these 27
students?

Consider the following card game with a well-shuffled deck of cards. If you draw a red card,
you win nothing. If you get a spade, you win $5. For any club, you win $10 plus an extra $20
for the ace of clubs.

  - Create table (sometimes called a probability model) that expresses the amount you win at this game in terms of a random
  variable; i.e. a column for the possible values and another column for their repective
  probabilities. Also, find the expected winnings for a single game and the standard deviation of the winnings.
  - What is the maximum amount you would be willing to pay to play this game? Explain
your reasoning.

An airline charges the following baggage fees: $25 for the first bag and $35 for the second.
Suppose 54% of passengers have no checked luggage, 34% have one piece of checked luggage
and 12% have two pieces. We suppose a negligible portion of people check more than two bags.

  - Build a probability model, compute the expected revenue per passenger, and compute the
corresponding standard deviation.
  - About how much revenue should the airline expect for a flight of 120 passengers? With
what standard deviation? Note any assumptions you make and if you think they are
justified.
